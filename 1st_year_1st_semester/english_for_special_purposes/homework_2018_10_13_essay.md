## Essay

There is widely accepted point of view in modern western society that family as a social construct undergoes a deep crisis. Birth rate dropped below the threshold of population self reproduction in developed countries. Women give birth to the first child later and later, hence less children could be raised during woman's lifespan statistically. Rate of divorce is increasing year by year. All these things show that the family and the social values on which it is based are in decline.

To tackle this problem many scientists are doing their research on how globalization, ever-growing influence of internet and mobile devices affecting the human sense of reality, system of values and structure of modern society. The governments of developed countries constantly issue new legislations in order to improve incentive for people to have more babies, to stay in marriage. But, as we see, it does not bring a lot of results.

So should we panic? Is there any answer? My opinion is no, there is no ready answer, and no, we should not panic. There were many points in the history of mankind when it went through radical social changes. While progress in industry and information technology sped the pace of social development greatly since ancient times, we still can consider that process as a natural one. It has the same mechanism of self-regulation as natural selection. If some part of population become less inclined to reproduce it will shrink it's share and instinct with the time.

Wise governments are covering the natural loss of population with more open stance towards immigration. The better country's image and conditions for newcomers the more attractive it for people to come. Furthermore, if we take the whole world into consideration we will notice that population is still growing, which is a problem itself.

So if not the loss of population is the main problem of the family decline, then what? As I see it, the main problem is the fear of unknown, of what comes next.
